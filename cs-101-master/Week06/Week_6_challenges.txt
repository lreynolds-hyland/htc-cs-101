// 1. For Loop
// Use a for loop to give me the sum of all integers from 1 to 1000.



//2. Calculate the next leap years
//	- Leaps years are defined as follows:
//		* If the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year
//		* Except if the year is divisible by 100 then it IS NOT a lear year
//		* Except if the year is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year
//	- Write a program that does the following:
//		* Using the current year, generate the next 50 leap years
//		* Print these years out to the console



//3. Check if a string is a palindrome
//	- A palindrome is defined as follows:
//		* A group of characters that is the same forward as it is backwards
//	- Examples of some palindromes:
//		* Tacocat
//        * Hannah
//		* Kayak
//        * Never odd or even
//        * Rats live on no evil star
//        * A man, a plan, a canal - Panama!
//	- Palindromes normally do not take into account letter casing, spaces or punctuation
//	- Write a program that does the following:
//		* Asks the user to enter in a word or phrase
//		* Check to see if this string is a palindrome
//			* If it is a palindrome, print out Yes
//            * Otherwise, print out No
		
		
		
//4. Generate Fibonacci numbers
//	- Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers where the next integer is defined as the sum of the previous two values
//	- The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are as follows:
//		1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
//	- Write a program that does the following:
//		* Asks the user to enter an integer
//        * Generate Fibonacci numbers out to this value
//        * Example:
//			> Enter an integer: 10
//			> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
