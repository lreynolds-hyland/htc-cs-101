# Week 1: Class Introductions

## Overview
- Icebreaker
- Kahoot
- GitHub
- Repl.it
- Lecture

## Icebreaker
This should be a quick activity so that the students can get to know each other a little bit.

## Kahoot
**Students should use their real name for this Kahoot!** The purpose of this Kahoot is to gather a snapshot of what the students knew going into C# 101 and compare to what they learned during the last week for 101. For this information to be useful it helps to see how each student performed. **Be sure to save the kahoot results!**

## GitHub
Introduce GitHub using the material here: https://gitlab.hylandqa.net/tech-outreach/utilities/tree/master/GitLesson

Explain how we will use GitHub throughout the semester. All of the students should have GitHub accounts. They should fork and clone the C# 101 repository. They do not need to push/pull this lesson.

## Repl.it
All of the students should have enrolled in the C# 101 course on Repl.it. Make sure every student has enrolled, and explain the general flow:
- Students receive an email when a new assignment appears
- Students complete the assignment online
- Students receive points for completing the assignment
- Students should not spend longer than 30 minutes on the assignments

## Lecture
Lecture for each section should be simple. 

When all main topics are covered moved into the 'Building your first C# Program' PowerPoint and guide the class through a simple "Hello World!" program.

## Reward Program
Reward program is an incentive to get the students involved. Explain that points are awarded for answering questions, asking good questions, doing well on Kahoots (awarding points can vary from session to session, just be consistent all semester long).
