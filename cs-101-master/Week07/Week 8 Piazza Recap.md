This week's major topics were loops! Specifically While loops. So let's do a quick recap of the structure of these loops.

```C#
while (true)
{
//do something
}
```

While loops are ideal when we don't know exactly how many times we need to execute our code, but we have a way of testing if we need to run it again, specifically using some type of Boolean expression.
 
The while loop only has one condition we need to worry about:
 
`while (/*some condition is TRUE*/)`
 
So what can this some condition be? Well it can be anything that equates to a boolean expression, some examples:
 
`while (Console.Readline() != "STOP") //as long as our user doesn't type 'STOP' we keep running our code`
 
 ```C#
int myInt = 0;
while ( myInt <= 7) //as long as myInt is less than or equal to 7 we keep running our code
{
Console.WriteLine(myInt);
}
```
Now my last example in particular has a problem, can you spot what it is? Currently myInt never changes values, so my program will just print the value 0 indefinitely. You may or may not have been tricked by a situation like this in our last Kahoot!
