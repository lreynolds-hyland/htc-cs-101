// 1. While Loop Guessing game
// Randomly pick a number, and Use a while loop to ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 20.
// Make them guess until they are correct.
// If the users guess is too high tell them too high.
// if the guess is too low, tell them too low.
// If the guess is correct, congratulate them, and break out of the loop.

//2. Calculate the next leap years
//	- Leaps years are defined as follows:
//		* If the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year
//		* Except if the year is divisible by 100 then it IS NOT a lear year
//		* Except if the year is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year
//	- Write a program that does the following:
//		* Using the current year, generate the next 50 leap years
//		* Print these years out to the console

//3. Repeatedly print the value of a variable xValue, decreasing it by 0.5 each time,
as long as xValue remains positive
// - Start by asking the user for a number, then store the value in the xValue variable

//4. Print the square of the first 25 odd positive integers
