# Week 8: While Loops

Now that students have worked with For loops we can introduce them to While loop. Students seemed to have an easier time understanding the functionality of a while loop vs. the For historically. Enforce while loop translates the conditional statement to either true or false and continues to run as long as it equates to true. Other example to demonstrate is a bad conditional statement can result in an undesired infinite loop. If an infinite loop is desired, set the conditional to true and use a break statement to exit the loop.

If time allows introduce Arrays. Note: foreach loops are covered when talking about collections.  
 
## Pre-Work
Students should complete FizzBuzz bell work as they enter the room

### FizzBuzz:
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

 
Each of these are translated to either true or false and loop executes as long as it equates to true. The string and Boolean example above create infinite loops, demonstrate why these maybe useful and how to break out using a break; statement.
