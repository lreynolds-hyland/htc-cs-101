1. Even Numbers in an Array
===========================
1. Create a new integer array with 5 values.
2. Set each of the array values to the 1st 5 even numbers.
3. Print them out to the Console



2. List of Names
================
1. Create a new List of Strings
2. Add these names to the list: Alice, Bob, Charles, Danielle, Edgar and Frannie
3. Ask the user to add another name to the list
4. Ask the user for a name to check if it in the list
5. Use a foreach loop to check if it is.
6. Tell the user if the name is in the list or not.



3. Create a collection of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers
========================================================
Recall that the Fibonacci series is defined by the the nth number is the sum of the two previous
f[n] = f[n-1] + f[n-2]  => 0,1,1,2,3,5 ...
Use this information to find and store the first 100 fibonacci numbers.
1. Start with 0 and 1 as the first 2 numbers.
2. Find the next by adding the first two together.
3. Ask the user to  for a number between 1 and 100
4. Print the fibonacci number of the number provided.



4. Check if a string is a palindrome
=========================================================
- A palindrome is defined as follows:
	* A group of characters that is the same forward as it is backwards
- Examples of some palindromes:
    * Tacocat
    * Hannah
    * Kayak
    * Never odd or even
    * Rats live on no evil star
    * (EXTRA CHALLENGE) A man, a plan, a canal - Panama!
- Palindromes normally do not take into account letter casing, spaces or punctuation
- Write a program that does the following:
	* Asks the user to enter in a word or phrase
	* Check to see if this string is a palindrome
		* If it is a palindrome, print out Yes
        * Otherwise, print out No
