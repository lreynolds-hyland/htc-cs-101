Week 5 Challenges
 1. Let's practice some of our arithmetic
 a. Write a method that takes in a number and adds 1 to it, return your new number
	- try to use some of the new arithmetic operators you learned!
 b. Write a method that takes in a number and adds 3 to that number, return your new number 
 c. Write a method that takes in a number and multiplys that number by 3, return your new number 


2. Calculate the next leap years
 Write a method that asks the user for a year
 Write another method that takes that user input and determines if it is a leap year
	- Leaps years are defined as follows:
		* If the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year
		* Except if the year is divisible by 100 then it IS NOT a lear year
		* Except if the year is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year
 For an extra challenge:
	- Write a program that does the following:
		* Using the current year, generate the next 50 leap years
		* Print these years out to the console
