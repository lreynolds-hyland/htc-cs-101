Week 5 Homework 

1. Let's practice some of our arithmetic
a. Write a method that takes in a number and adds 1 to it, return your new number
    - try to use some of the new arithmetic operators you learned!
b. Write a method that takes in a number and adds 3 to that number, return your new number 
c. Write a method that takes in a number and multiples that number by 3, return your new number


2. A little more challenging! Calculate the next leap years.

Write a method that asks the user for a year
Write another method that takes that user input and determines if it is a leap year

- Leaps years are defined as follows:
* If the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year
* Except if the year is divisible by 100 then it IS NOT a leap year
* Except if the year is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year
