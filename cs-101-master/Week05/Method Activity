# Method Activity

## Purpose

The purpose of this activity is to introduce methods in a new light for our students. Previously this has been one of the most difficult subjects for us to teach.
The goal will be for students to play the role of the 'computer' in a live action scenario. 

## Instructions

Students will play the role of the computer and perform the following tasks:
    - Get user input
    - Call a method to perform a mathematical operand (Instructors 2 & 3)
    - Return the output of the method to the main method
    - Write the result to the Console Window (The white Board) 

Roles of the Instructors:
    One instructor will play as user input. Students will ask the instructor 3 questions:
        1) What mathematical operand to perform
        2) Value 1
        3) Value 2

    The other 2 instructors I'll play the roles of the methods. One performing an addition method to sum our inputs and one to perform subtraction to return our difference.
    They will play an additional role of a `If/Elseif` tree. Students will always check with the instructors in order to see if they are the operator they need, else try the other, else write fail.

## Process 

a) Student `A` will approach instructor `1` and ask the following questions:
    1) What mathematical operand to perform
    2) Value 1
    3) Value 2

b) Student will then perform the `if/elseif` logic to find the method they need. Always checking instructor `2` and then `3`. 
    If they have an invalid value of `multiply` or `divide` then they enter the `else` block which is to write `invalid user input` on the Board

c) Students will hand their paper over to the `method` instructor and await for the method to return a value. 

d) When the value is returned the students must then write the value on the white board (Console Window) and reenter the que.
