Grade Checker
=============
Your teacher needs some help! They need an application that can transform a numerical grade value into a letter grade, and you have the skills and know-how to help them out! 
Your program should prompt the user for a numeric letter grade (integer value: 0 - 100). 
Remember, you will have to convert the value provided by Console.ReadLine() and store it in the appropriate data type!

Then construct logic that uses if, else if, and else to output a letter grade for the number
	A = 100-90, B = 89-80, C = 79-70, D = 69-65, F = 64-0
