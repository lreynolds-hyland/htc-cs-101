Final 3 weeks: Project time!
Show us what your learned
The final 3 weeks are for students to work on individual projects.

The first 2 weeks are for students to create their projects, what specifically they create is up to them! Examples in the past are Hangman, Create your own story, Mad-lib generators, simple databases with menu options, and rock paper scissors! All we ask is students follow these required objectives:
1)	Use a loop! Can be For, Foreach or while. Up to them!
2)	Use at least one method, show us you understand how to use them
By case: If you see a student using a project that would benefit from using a collection, drive them to use one!

Past experiences:
	It is advised students work alone, in group projects it has been difficult to see who actually did the majority of the work and if anyone was lacking understanding. Working solo will help better advice who should move on to advanced and who should retake

The last week:
	Present project to class! Run through the application once to show us what it does. Then have students show and explain what their loop and method do (just so we know they use them)
