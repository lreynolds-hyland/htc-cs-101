# Week 4: Advanced Boolean operators

## Overview
The main focus for this week is the Boolean Operators `&&` and `||`. Students will need to reinforce that boolean statements equate to either `true` or `false` and how these values interact with the Boolean Operators. For the `||` operand at least one value on right or left MUST be `true`. For `&&` BOTH the right and left side must equate to `true`. At least a quarter of the class with thing if both sides of a `&&` are false, that the statement as a whole will equate to `true`. Enforce that it is not a matter of the values being the same, but a matter of the values being `true`. 

Optional: After students have demonstrated they understand how to use if/elseif logic, introduce them to Switches. We do not expect students to master the use of Switches, but rather expose them to the concept now and during student projects if they have a project that could benefit from the use of a Switch (such as choose your own story or some type of menu) help the student work that into their project.

## Class Objective
* Explain how `&&` and `||` operate
	* for `||` to be true, either `true || false`, `false || true` or `true || true`
	* for `&&` to be true, MUST be `true && true`
* Cover how order of operations applies to `&&` and `||`
	* `&&` is evaluated before `||` unless `( )` are used
* Be able to evaluate (overly complex statements) to either `true` or `false`
* (Optional) Introduce Switch statements, Exposure over mastery for this topic

## Warmup Question
Display the following question at the beginning of the lesson and have the students answer and discuss it:
>What type of data might you display in a Venn diagram?

## Lecture
* Lecture/guided lesson with '6 Boolean Operators'

* (Optional) 'Switch Statements' 
	* Introduce an scenario where a `switch` statement could replace a series of `if else` checks, like a console menu`

## Individual Exercises
Week 4 challenge work:
* Boolean Operators
	* Note: Students dont need to code these, just in note pad keep track of each one individually and see if it equates to `true` or `false`
* Extra Challenge (Tow zone signs)
	* Note: Students are not expected to complete this due to time, however it may be over the top but not impossible for them 

## Post-Work
	To students: Write any outstanding questions to Piazza

## Wrap-Up Message (Piazza)
Items to cover in Piazza message:
1. Recap the ways to evaluate a conditional statement to Boolean statement (>,<,==)
2. Recap the purpose of If/else branches and how conditional statements are used to evaluate them
3. Recap the Boolean Operators used in class: `&&` and `||`.
4. Be sure to include an example of the `!` operand
5. If covered in class, recap what a switch statement is. Again, switches should be an exposure over mastery topic. Some students will have good projects at the end of the semester to utilize switches
6. Post Homework (if any)
