Come up with a program that asks the user for three things.

1. What day of the week is it? 
2. What hour of the day is it? (Military Time)
3. What is the current Temperature? (Use an integer for this).


I want your program to tell me where the user will be based on these rules: 

If it’s a weekday (Monday thru Friday) and its between 9am and 3pm. I will be at school, regardless of the temperature.
If it’s a Monday, or Wednesday, or Friday and its between 4pm and 7pm, and the temperature is above 50 degrees, I will be at soccer practice.
If its Tuesday or Thursday, and it’s between 5pm, and 9pm, I will be at coding club, regardless of the temperature.
If its Saturday, and it’s between 12pm and 3pm, and the temperature is above 65 degrees I will be at the pool.
If its Saturday, and it’s between 12pm, and 7pm, and the temperature is below or equal to 65 degrees, I will be playing board games with friends.
If it’s between 12am (midnight), and 11am on any day of the week, regardless of the temperature, I will be asleep.

However, if it’s between 10pm, and 7am, on a weekday, regardless of the temperature, I will also be asleep.
At any other time, I will be at home, but not asleep.

If I say between 5pm and 9pm, assume that at exactly 9pm, I will no longer be doing the thing.

Get as far as you can with this, and submit your assignment URL in a private message on piazza.
